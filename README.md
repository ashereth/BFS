## Files

## List.c/.h
An implimentation of a doubly linked list data structure for use within the the graph data structure.

## Graph.c/.h
An implimentation of a Graph data structure along with the BFS() algorithm that can be used to solve \
SSSP.

## FindPath.c
Makes use of the List.c and Graph.c ADT modules in order to read in an input file and use it to populate a graph \
as well as find the SSSP on some given sources and vertices.

## GraphTest
Test client for GraphTest. Tests all graph ADT functions to make sure it all works properly.

## Makefile
Makes all needed executables.
